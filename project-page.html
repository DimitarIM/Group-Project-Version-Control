            <h2>About Repositories</h2>
            <p>Repositories are necessary to collaborate with multiple developers on the same project simultaneously and to have a remote backup in case something happens to your local machine.</p>
            <p> To create one, click on the + icon in the top right corner of the GitHub homepage and select "New repository" from the dropdown menu. Then click on the create button and use the SSH link to copy the link into the terminal right after the git command "git clone". </p>

            <h2>Essential Commands</h2>
            <p> When you've created your repository you can add your new files with the command "git add .". After that, you commit the added files to the repository with a message describing what you've done.
                Another two important commands are git push and pull which will respectivly push your changes to the remote repository and pull from the repository into your local machine.
