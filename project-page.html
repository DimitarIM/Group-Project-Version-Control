    Explain why repositories are necessary: 
    1. Collaboration: They allow multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.
    2. Backup: Hosting your code on a remote server ensures that you have a backup in case something happens to your local machine.
    3. Traceability: They provide a complete history of changes made to the codebase.

    Detail how other people can contribute to the project
    1. Create a new branch for your changes
    2. make the necessary changes to the codebase in your local repository
    3. create a pull request: Go to the original repository on GitHub.
        Click the Compare & pull request button.
        Provide a title and description for your pull request, explaining what changes you made and why.
