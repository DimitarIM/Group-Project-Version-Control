            <p class="paragraph1">
                Repositories are necessary to collaborate with developers on the same project simultaneously and to have a remote backup in case something happens to your local machine.
                Click on the + icon in the top right corner of the GitHub homepage and select "New repository". Then use the SSH link to copy the link into the terminal right after the git command "git clone". 
            </p>

            <span class="title-text2">Essential Commands</span><br>
            <p class="paragraph2"> 
                Now you can add your new files with the command "git add ." and commit the added files to the repository with a message describing what you've done.
                Another two important commands are git push and pull which will respectivly push and pull changes from/to the remote repository.          
                This is the best way to work as a team because each member of the team can create a new branch to make their own changes, give feedback directly on Github and merge all the individual codes to the main project.
