                To add code to an existing repository, start by cloning the repository or pulling the latest changes. Then, create a new branch to work on your feature or bug fix. Make your code changes, stage them using git add, and commit them with a meaningful message. Push the branch to the remote repository and create a pull request for others to review your changes. Once the pull request is reviewed and approved, merge it into the main branch. Finally, pull the latest changes to ensure your local repository is up-to-date, and delete the feature branch if needed.

                To clone the repository, use the "git clone <repository-url>" command, which downloads the project locally. Use "git checkout -b <branch-name>" to create a new branch for your changes. After editing files, stage them with "git add <file-name>" (or "git add ." to stage all changes), and commit your changes with "git commit -m "branch-name"". Push the branch to the remote repository using "git push origin <branch-name>". Once done, create a pull request for review. After approval and merging, update your local branch with "git pull origin main" to sync it with the latest changes.
